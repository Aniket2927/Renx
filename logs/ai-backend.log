All model checkpoint layers were used when initializing TFRobertaForSequenceClassification.

All the layers of TFRobertaForSequenceClassification were initialized from the model checkpoint at finiteautomata/bertweet-base-sentiment-analysis.
If your task is similar to the task the model of the checkpoint was trained on, you can already use TFRobertaForSequenceClassification for predictions without further training.

All model checkpoint layers were used when initializing TFRobertaForSequenceClassification.

All the layers of TFRobertaForSequenceClassification were initialized from the model checkpoint at finiteautomata/bertweet-base-sentiment-analysis.
If your task is similar to the task the model of the checkpoint was trained on, you can already use TFRobertaForSequenceClassification for predictions without further training.
