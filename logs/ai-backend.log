All model checkpoint layers were used when initializing TFRobertaForSequenceClassification.

All the layers of TFRobertaForSequenceClassification were initialized from the model checkpoint at finiteautomata/bertweet-base-sentiment-analysis.
If your task is similar to the task the model of the checkpoint was trained on, you can already use TFRobertaForSequenceClassification for predictions without further training.
